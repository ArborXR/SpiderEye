# Introduction

Write .Net (Core) applications with a webview UI. It can be compared to how Electron runs on Node.js, SpiderEye runs on .Net.
Contrary to Electron though, SpiderEye uses the OS native webview instead of bundling Chrome.

What's the name supposed to mean? Simple: what kind of view does a spiders eye have? A webview! Get it? ...you'll laugh later :P

### About
This library is here to communicate from the webview to the host and vice versa.
The `SpiderEye` class is the basis for communication and provides methods to invoke something on the host or receive events from the host.
Additionally, there are various classes for specific APIs like `BrowserWindow`or `MessageBox` etc.
